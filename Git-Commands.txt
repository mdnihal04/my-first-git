git clone (repository->code->https->copy)

or can fork that (if public) and clone it...

then can change branch...default branch is "main"

git branch (to check available branch)

git checkout "branch-name" ( to check if i am on that branch or not)


git checkout -b "new-branch" ( to create new and switch to that branch)
